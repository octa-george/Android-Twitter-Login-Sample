Twitter Login Sample
============================

To get started please edit the string.xml Consumer Key & Consumer Secret with your own keys.

```sh
<string name="twitter_consumer_key">XXX</string>
<string name="twitter_consumer_secret">XXX</string>
```
  

To get the Consumer Key & Consumer Secret, you have to create an app in Twitter via.

Please follow the steps below:

###New App###

* Log into  the [Twitter Developers] section.

 > If you don't already have an account, you can login with your normal Twitter credentials
Go to [Create an app]

* Fill in the details of the application you'll be using to connect with the API

 > Your application **name must be unique**. If someone else is already using it, you won't be able to register your application until you can think of something that isn't being used.

* Click on **Create your Twitter application**

* Details of your new app will be shown along with your consumer key and consumer secret.

* If you need access tokens, scroll down and click **Create my access token**

 > The page will then refresh on the "Details" tab with your new access tokens. You can recreate these at any time if you need to.
By default your apps will be granted for read-only access. To change this, go to the Settings tab and change the access level required in the "Application Type" section.

###Existing app###

* To get the consumer and access tokens for an existing application, go to [My applications] (which is available from the menu in the upper-right).
